# Wifi Hotspot

By default, the device IP is [http://10.3.141.1/](http://10.3.141.1/) after connecting hotspot.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hotspot SSID: `DS_PDU_xxxx` \(xxxx is Last four digits of Ethernet Mac Address\)

Initial Password: `ChangeMe`
{% endhint %}

If you connect the device to a local network, the ethernet IP is still available. For example, the device IP is 192.168.30.1 in the local network. Then you can go to Dashboard through http://192.168.30.1/ or http://10.3.141.1/.

**Note**: Access to the device through a phone/tablet might be slow in some cases.
