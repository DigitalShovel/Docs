## Introduction

Allow customers to use spare ports for other purposes.

## Update Device

For example, a Smart PDU has 46 ports, one customer uses 43 ports for `Miner`, 4 ports for `Exhaust`, and 1 port for `Heater`. In this case, customers can do the following:

1. Go to Dashboard, change ID 1-4 ports `Type` to `Exhaust`.
2. Change ID 5 ports `Type` to `Heater`.
3. In this case, users **are not able** to control Port 1-5. 
4. Go to `Sensor & Device` -&gt; `DashBoard`
5. Setup device and drag to reset priority.
